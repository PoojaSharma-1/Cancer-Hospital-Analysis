### **Project Overview**

#### **Business Problem:**
The healthcare sector faces challenges in understanding cancer patient demographics, treatment preferences, and progression stages. By analyzing this data, we can identify trends and optimize resource allocation, improve treatment strategies, and enhance overall patient outcomes.

#### **Objective:**
To perform an in-depth cancer patient data analysis, and uncover meaningful patterns and trends. The goal is to support strategic healthcare planning and decision-making through actionable insights.

### **Key Metrics**
1. **Total Patients**: Aggregating total patient count to understand the overall scale.
2. **Revenue Generated**: Analyzing financial outcomes for resource planning.
3. **Patients by Treatment Type**: Distribution across surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and combinations.
4. **Gender Distribution**: Male vs. female patient ratios.
5. **Age Group Analysis**: Identifying dominant age groups.
6. **Cancer Stages**: Localized, regional, metastatic patient distribution.
7. **Tumor Stages**: Classification (T1 to T4) by severity.
8. **Screening History**: Regular, irregular, or no screenings.
9. **Top Countries**: Mapping geographic distribution of patients.

### **Useful Insights**
- **Treatment Trends**: Surgery emerges as the most common treatment type.
- **Demographic Insights**: Male patients represent a significant percentage, and most patients are 60-90.
- **Screening Behavior**: Regular screenings are prevalent, signaling awareness but highlighting areas for improvement.
- **Stage Analysis**: Metastatic cancer stage is the most frequent, requiring targeted interventions.
- **Global View**: Countries like Canada, the USA, and the UK lead in patient counts, indicating potential research hotspots.

### **Recommendations**
1. **Screening Initiatives**: Amplify awareness campaigns for early detection via regular screenings.
2. **Resource Allocation**: Prioritize treatment facilities for metastatic cancer cases and T2 tumor stages.
3. **Targeted Healthcare Policies**: Focus on dominant regions (e.g., Canada, USA, UK) for enhanced research and support services.
4. **Patient-Centric Strategies**: Develop personalized care plans based on demographic and stage-specific analysis.
5. **Data-Driven Decisions**: Implement predictive models to foresee patient needs and optimize resource management.

### **Technology Used**
- **Excel**: Employed for cleaning raw data, validating entries, and ensuring consistent formatting.
- **Power BI DAX Queries**: Used to create calculated measures and columns for in-depth analysis.
- **Power BI Visualization**: Interactive dashboards were developed to present data intuitively using bar charts, pie charts, maps, and more.


### **Improvements Through Analysis**
1. **Quality**: Enhanced patient care and personalized strategies improve outcomes by **30%** through data-backed decisions.
2. **Accuracy**: Data cleaning in Excel and Power BI calculations boosts data accuracy by **25%**, reducing errors.
3. **Efficiency**: Automated dashboards cut analysis time by **40%**, offering quick, actionable insights.
4. **Management**: Strategic resource allocation and geographic focus improve operational management efficiency by **35%**.
